<h4> Short Bio </h4>



<p> Nilesh Suriyarachchi received the honors degree in electronic and telecommunications engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2017. <br>
He is currently a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA,
working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://johnbaras.com/"> John S. Baras</a>,
Distinguished University Professor and Chair in Systems Engineering. <br>
His research focuses on using optimization, control and learning techniques to harness the collaborative capabilities of connected autonomous vehicles in order to solve many of the existing problems plaguing modern transportation networks. </p>


<!-- <p> Since 2017, he has worked as a graduate research assistant at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, 
and as a research intern for the Math and Algorithms Research Group 
at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, NJ, USA
(advised by
